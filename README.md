# AzureAIHackathon
Industrial Object Training by capture, identify, and visualize industrial things with Mixed Reality and Azure Cognitive Service


## INTRODUCTION

People who work in industrial manufacturers should be able to do their task with high accuracy, fast, and great mobility. Also they are sometimes working in different environment or area and need to bring a lot of tools and knowledge with them every time.
Many manufacturers are still using paper based and data on pc or notebook to get guidance of worker tasks. This method is not simple and takes lot of time. They could not interact with object and information in the same time. By using custom vision of Azure AI and Mixed Reality, workers can do it all in the same time and also collaborate with others. This combination bring high accuracy, fast, and great mobility to them

## CURRENT PROBLEM CASE

When engineer working with manufacturer's equipment or tool, they are sometimes need guidance or info of that thing. Traditional way to getting info of tools is using paper based documentation or looking at digital data inside a laptop, tablet, or a phone.
Another case is when new engineer comes in, and they need to learn about some equipment, most company now days are made a taking time training using class interaction. Or, engineer should learn it by itself from manual books to identify and know about it.
This behavior costing a lot of time and manual process to do. Engineer could not act and use on those equipment or tool faster and less mobility

## SOLUTION IDEA

1. Capture the object or things
2. Identify the object by using Custom Vision of Azure AI
3. Getting all information about it from cloud
4. Visualized those information on the object with Hologram

Now engineer can do their task without bothering searching for documentation

## TECHNOLOGY

1. Mixed Reality Device : Capture the object and visualized data with Hologram
2. Cloud Infrastructure + AI : Analyzed and recognized the image with cognitive service
3. Centralized Control App : Control and manage data to be latest update

Current simple architecture of project's platform:

## FUTURE PLAN AFTER THE CAMPAIGN

* Making training platform based on Mixed Reality and AI technology to transform how people learning about their tasks
* Making platform that users easily use and scale
* Publish as open source project, so people can contribute to the project. Make it cover many tools and workflow from many industries

## CONSTRAINTS

* Author currently has limited dataset to use
* Author will using some dummy or simple objects that can be found around
* Author using simple visualization
